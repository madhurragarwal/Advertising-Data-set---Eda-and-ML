# 1. Introduction
This README document provides an overview of an advertising dataset and outlines the steps taken for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the development of a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a customer clicking on an online advertisement.

# 2. Dataset Overview
1. Dataset Name: advertising.csv
2. Data Source: Kaggle
3. Data Description: The dataset contains information related to online advertising campaigns. It includes various features such as age, gender, daily time spent on the internet, etc., and a binary target variable indicating whether or not a customer clicked on the advertisement.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Data Preprocessing
1. Missing Data: Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
2. Data Cleaning: Remove any outliers or irrelevant data points.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features if needed.

# Data Exploration
1. Univariate Analysis: Explore individual features using histograms, box plots, etc.
2. Bivariate Analysis: Investigate relationships between features and the target variable.
3. Multivariate Analysis: Examine correlations between features and identify any patterns.

# 4. Logistic Regression
# Data Splitting
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

# Model Training
1. Use logistic regression to build a predictive model.
2. Train the model using the training dataset.
3. Perform hyperparameter tuning if necessary.

# Model Evaluation
1. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
2. Visualize the results using confusion matrices or ROC curves.
3. Interpret the coefficients of the logistic regression model.

# 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this project involves the analysis of an advertising dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and the development of a logistic regression model to predict advertisement click-through rates. By following the steps outlined in this README, you will be able to perform EDA, preprocess the data, train a logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.
